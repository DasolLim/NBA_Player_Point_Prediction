# NBA Player Point Prediction
Training an AI Model to Predict NBA player points

## Introduction:
The growing popularity of fantasy basketball has highlighted the need for objective, data-driven strategies to
enhance decision-making. Traditional betting and player performance predictions often suffer from subjective biases and
incomplete analysis, leading to unreliable outcomes. This project proposes a machine learning model designed to predict player
performance thresholds—such as scoring more than 10 or 20 points—while identifying the key features influencing these
benchmarks. By leveraging historical player statistics, including points scored, games played, and shooting efficiency, the
model reduces subjectivity and increases predictive objectivity. The methodology encompasses data collection,
preprocessing, and testing the Random Forests algorithm, fine-tuned through cross-validation. Expected accuracy ranges from
75–85%, ensuring balanced predictions that are both reliable and generalizable. By providing actionable insights, this
system aims to empower users with confidence in their betting strategies, minimize reliance on subjective intuition, and
ultimately contribute to increasing their overall assets.

## Methodology:
Model Development
The project explored three machine learning algorithms to identify the most suitable model for player performance
prediction:
1) Linear Regression: Used as a baseline for its simplicity
and interpretability. Logarithmic transformations were applied
to capture non-linear relationships in the data.

3) Random Forests: This ensemble method was employed
due to its robustness in handling large datasets and its ability to
model complex feature interactions. Feature importance scores
generated by Random Forests further informed feature
selection.

5) Gradient Boosting: Gradient Boosting algorithms, such
as XGBoost, were used for their ability to improve predictive
accuracy by iteratively refining weak learners. Hyperparameter
tuning was conducted to optimize performance.
C. Model Training and Validation
To ensure generalizability and prevent overfitting, the
following evaluation protocols were applied:
1) Cross-Validation: A 5-fold cross-validation method
was applied to assess the model's performance across multiple
data subsets, ensuring its robustness and reliability.
2) Evaluation Metrics: The model's performance was
evaluated using precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. These
metrics offered a thorough understanding of its ability to
effectively balance true positives and false positives.
3) Hyperparameter Tuning: Important parameters,
including the number of estimators, maximum depth, and
learning rate, were fine-tuned using grid search to improve the
model's performance.
